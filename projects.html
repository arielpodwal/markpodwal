              The Bible calls idolatry an “abomination.” When King Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, to promote Greek culture he forbid Jewish religious practices, even desecrating the Holy Temple with an idol of Zeus. The festival of Hanukkah celebrates the Temple’s re-dedication following the victory over Antiochus.

              After Titus destroyed Jerusalem in the year 70, the Romans built the city Aelia Capitolina on its ruins. With the loss of their homeland, Jews moved to distant lands. Though dispersed, they refused to abandon their faith.

              On their way to free Jerusalem from the Saracens, Crusaders killed thousands of Jews in the Rhine Valley. A chronicle asserted, “We go to fight God’s enemies in the East; but before our eyes are Jews, a race more hostile to God than any other.” Of the massacre in Mainz, Solomon bar Samson lamented, “Why did the heavens not darken when eleven hundred souls were slaughtered?”

              The Third Crusade, led by Richard the Lion-Heart, stirred anti-Jewish riots across England. In York, Jews gathered for protection in Clifford’s Tower. Rather than be butchered by the mob outside, many Jews took their own lives. Those who surrendered were murdered. All records of debts owed to Jews were burned.

              The ultimate act of Kiddush ha-Shem, sanctification of God’s holy name, is when a Jew sacrifices his or her life rather than transgressing any of God’s cardinal laws. Eyewitnesses chronicled a number of Jewish communal self- martyrdoms, which came to be revered as the purest expression of the devotion to God.

              The Lateran Council in 1215 decreed that Jews “be publicly differentiated by their clothing.” Throughout Europe, Jews were forced to wear a “Badge of Shame,” often a yellow circle. Yellow implied wickedness and the circular form of a coin might have signified the Jews’ role as moneylender.

              Psalm 119:160 <em>All Your words are true and eternal</em><br><br>
              The Talmud is a collection of ancient rabbinic writings on Jewish law and tradition. In the Jewish religion, the Talmud is second only to the Bible. Condemned as blasphemous to Christianity and a barrier to converting the Jews, the Talmud was repeatedly censored and burned. The most infamous burning was in Paris. A thousand years earlier when Romans wrapped Rabbi Hanina in a Torah scroll and set it on fire his disciples called out, “Rabbi, what do you see?” His answer expressed the indestructible nature of the Law, “The parchment is burning but the letters are soaring on high.”

              The Judensau (Jew’s pig) is a derogatory medieval depiction of Jews in obscene contact with a large sow. The image reflected the tendency to dehumanize Jews iconographically. The pig was used intentionally since for Jews it is an object of religious prohibition and revulsion. Over 25 Judensau remain on German churches. During the Nazi period, school children were taken to see them.

              The Black Death annihilated a third of Europe’s population. Rumor attributed the devastating plague to an international conspiracy of Jewry to poison all Christendom. Jews arrested and tortured not surprisingly confessed to anything. In hundreds of towns, falsely accused Jews were butchered and burned to death.

              Before the Black Death massacre in Erfurt, Germany, Jews preemptively hid their valuables including a ceremonial gold wedding ring unearthed in 1998. To no avail, Pope Clement VI acknowledged that Jews died of the plague as frequently as Christians and there was no reason to blame them.

              One Easter, during a devastating pogrom, Prague’s Jews fled for safety to their synagogues. Rabbi Avigdor Kara, who lost his entire family, wrote the eulogy <em>All that Suffering</em>, still read each year on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur. For centuries bloodstains remained on a synagogue’s walls as a reminder of the slaughter. Legend says that whenever there is Jewish suffering in the world, the walls again turn red.

              “Humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them,” says the Qur’an regarding the Jews. As a rule, Jews living in Muslim lands were allowed to practice their religion as dhimmis (protected people). Yet, at times anti-Jewish sentiment surfaced if Jews became too influential. In Fez, Morocco, when the Sultan appointed a Jew as Prime Minister the town revolted. The Sultan and his Minister were assassinated and the Jews massacred.

              The Spanish Inquisition was initiated to prevent conversos from engaging in Jewish practices, which as Christians they were to have rejected. Those who in secret continued to practice Judaism were called marranos. At public spectacles, heretics were burned at the stake in an auto-da-fe, “act of faith.”

              The “blood libel,” also known as “ritual murder,” refers to the false allegation that Jews kill Christians to use their blood in the baking of Passover matzah (unleavened bread). The accusation, dating back to the Middle Ages, is especially ludicrous because Jewish law prohibits consuming any blood. In 1899, a Jew from the Bohemian town of Polná was convicted of the murder of a Christian girl. A ritually inspired crime was alleged to be the motive.

              Among the most poignant documents of the Holocaust are poems and drawings by the imprisoned children of the Terezin Concentration Camp. Depicted is their daily misery as well as their hopes. Perhaps the most famous of the poems is “I never saw another butterfly,” by Pavel Friedman who was killed in Auschwitz. Terezin was unique in that it was created to conceal the German genocide of the Jews. This ghetto was the site of an International Red Cross Committee delegation visit in 1944, when the real suffering in the camp was hidden. With its many artists and intellectuals, culture flourished in Terezin - together with disease, starvation and constant fear of deportations to the east.

               In September 1943, more than five thousand Jews were deported from Terezin to Auschwitz. Unlike previous transports, they received unusual privileges: they did not undergo the usual selections and families were not divided up into various sections in the camp - hence the “family camp.” On the night of March 8, 1944 the Jewish holiday of Purim, exactly six months after their arrival, the family camp prisoners still living from that bleak September – 3792 persons - were murdered in the gas chambers. The absolute majority of them were Czech Jews. It was the deadliest night during the German occupation of the Czech lands.

              Although history and legend merge regarding Mozart’s five visits to Prague, both make clear that Prague adored Mozart. And Mozart, in turn, loved Prague. Mozart is claimed to have said, <em>"Meine Prager verstehen mich."</em> ("My Praguers understand me"), and he wrote of Prague’s theater orchestra, “My orchestra is in Prague.” Arthur Schurig, one of Mozart’s biographers, noted, “If any town has the right to be called his city, then it is not Salzburg, which W.A. Mozart hated, it is not Vienna, which left him to starve and forgot him in a mass grave, but only his golden Prague.”

              Prince Archbishop Colloredo condescendingly regarded musicians as mere servants to be employed at their master’s whim. Mozart objected to being so disdained and sought greater freedom both as a performer and as a composer. After the archbishop accepted Mozart's second letter of resignation, the archbishop’s chief steward, Count Arco, literally dismissed the composer "with a kick in the arse."

The Duscheks are credited with having been the first to invite Mozart to Prague.

              Emperor Joseph II commissioned the opera <em>The Abduction from the Seraglio,</em> which premiered in Vienna in 1782. It is said that after the opera’s premiere the emperor complained to Mozart, “That is too fine for my ears. There are too many notes.” Mozart reportedly replied, “There are exactly as many notes as there should be.” But according to the French writer Stendhal, Mozart later felt that perhaps the emperor had not been wrong.

Mozart’s biographer, Franz Xaver Niemetschek, attended the opera’s Prague premiere in 1783 and later wrote that the audience was overwhelmed.

Describing his impressions in a letter to a friend in Vienna, Mozart wrote, “…viewing everything with utmost interest…our eyes had almost fallen out of their sockets for all the sightseeing…” A Mozart Memorial collection was established at the Klementinum’s University Library in1837, four years prior to the founding of the Salzburg Mozarteum. The Klementinum’s was the first Mozarteum in the world and the first-ever bust of Mozart can be found in the foyer of the Mirror Chapel.

Praguers must have been delighted that the symphony’s last movement quoted an aria from Figaro since Figaro was such an enormous success in Prague. Yet the symphony may not have been initially composed for Prague and its premiere there simply fortuitous.

              Mozart’s only composition during his first visit to Prague was a set of German dances. According to Mozart’s biographer Georg Nikolaus von Nissen, Count Pachta invited Mozart to arrive for a dinner party an hour before the other guests. The count led him into a room already equipped with paper, pen and ink, and instructed Mozart to compose some long-promised dances to be performed that evening. Within the hour, Mozart handed the count the full score of a set of six dances.

The family was well known for its arts patronage and the palace became an important center of cultural life in the city. To this day, pairs of giants flank both entrances to the palace.

              Eduard Friedrich Mörike’s Mozart on the Journey to Prague was written as a tribute for the centennial of the composer’s birth. The novella tells of how, on his way to Prague with Constanze for the premiere of <em>Don Giovanni</em>, Mozart thoughtlessly plucks an orange from a Bohemian family's garden. Just as he slices the fruit, he is caught by an angry gardener. Anxious to get away, Mozart scribbles an apologetic note to the tree’s owners. Shortly afterward, he is not only forgiven but also welcomed by this aristocratic family that adores his music. The story ends with the count presenting the Mozarts with a beautiful coach in which to continue their journey.

Lorenzo Da Ponte, the new opera’s librettist, supposedly was living just across the street in the Platýz House. It is said that the two collaborated by shouting at each other through their open windows.

The “Strahov Improvisation,” completed by the 20th-century Czech composer Jiří Ropek, can be heard today.

Some even say he was the prototype for the Don. In the opera, among the delicacies with which Don Giovanni intends to seduce his guests is chocolate, perhaps the inspiration for the marzipan-and-nougat-filled sweets called Mozartkugeln with their distinctive wrapper featuring a portrait of the composer.

According to Mozart’s son, Karl Thomas, Josepha Duschek gave Mozart ink, pen and paper and locked him in a room in Bertramka until he composed an aria to the words of the poem <em>Bella mia fiamma addio</em> (“Farewell, my beautiful flame”), which he had promised her. Mozart, so the story goes, wrote various difficult passages into the aria in order to get even with her and demanded that Josepha perform it perfectly or he would immediately destroy the piece. Duschek must have succeeded for she later sang the aria at concerts in Dresden and Leipzig during Mozart’s 1789 German tour.

In music, ornaments are embellishments that enhance the character of the melody. In Mozart’s time, string instruments themselves were occasionally ornamented with carvings to enhance their character. Here, the Prague coat of arms is ornamented with a violin bow in place of a sword to symbolize the forceful power of music.

Kleist wrote of the premiere of <em>La Clemenza di Tito,</em> “at that moment I wished to be Mozart rather than Leopold.” Yet, the imperial couple and their official guests, very few of whom were connoisseurs of music, were mostly bored. Only after the opera’s further performances did it receive the appreciation it merited.

              Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto in A Major was written in 1791 for his close friend, the clarinet virtuoso Anton Stadler. Stadler owned an unusual custom-made clarinet, a “basset clarinet,” with an extended lower range. Most likely the Clarinet Concerto in A Major is an adaptation of music initially composed for the basset clarinet. Though constantly short of funds, Mozart often loaned Stadler money, which was not repaid. Two months before Mozart died he gave the concerto and traveling money to Stadler in order for him to premiere the work in Prague. Stadler, a compulsive gambler, reputedly pawned the score.

Four thousand mourners attended a Mass in Mozart’s honor at St. Nicholas Church in Prague, which featured a Requiem by Kapellmeister Rössler who conducted 120 musicians, all performing without pay. Josepha Duschek sang an aria from that Requiem. Church bells rang for half an hour throughout the city. And for the following six years, Mozart’s Prague friends took care of his two sons.

              Although Mozart wrote in a letter to his family that his Italian opera, <em>La Finta Giardiniera,</em> had been a success when it premiered in Munich in 1775, in reality its run ended prematurely after only three performances. Throughout the rest of Mozart's lifetime, it was staged only as a <em>Singspiel</em> in a German translation. Five years after Mozart's death, the Italian version was revived at Prague’s “Patriotic Theater” (U Hybernů) with a reorchestrated score that sounded very much like Mozart’s later operas. Scholars have proposed that Mozart may have revised the score during his last years.

His melodies are so lovable, are so inspired and so inspiring, that only to hear them is the greatest enjoyment that exists in the world for me." Dvořák acknowledged Mozart’s influence on his early chamber music and once proclaimed that Mozart was “sunshine.” The funeral Mass for Dvořák in Prague’s Týn Church included a performance of Mozart’s Requiem.

          Verdi's <em>Nabucco,</em> based on the life of Nebuchadnezzar, the King of Babylon, was the inspiration for this original image. The artwork incorporates a winged Babylonian lion and broken Jewish ceremonial objects from various eras symbolizing the plight of the Jewish people throughout history.

          Mark Podwal's richly designed textiles for Prague's Altneuschul, the oldest and continually active synagogue in Europe, include a <em>Torah</em> ark cover, three <em>Torah</em> mantles and covers for the <em>Torah</em> reading and cantor’s desks. Built in 1270, the Altneuschul, or "Old-New Synagogue," is celebrated for its architectural beauty and legendary provenance–myth has it its stones were brought by angels. In collaboration with renowned New York textile embroiderers Penn & Fletcher, Podwal used modern technology to create vignettes of the centuries-old Prague Jewish Community.

In 1996, Mark Podwal designed an Aubusson tapestry for the main sanctuary's <em>Torah</em> ark. Each design for the five <em>Torah</em> mantles symbolizes one of the five books of Moses.

          The Agudas Achim synagogue in Brno, built in the 1930s, is an example of modern functionalistic architecture. During World War II, the synagogue was used as a warehouse, which resulted in considerable damage. After the war, it was reconsecrated but the property had not gone through any major structural modifications and fell into disrepair. In 2014 a major restoration project’s objective was to return the interior to its original condition. The renewed synagogue will serve not only its religious purposes - it will be open for the general public as well. Cultural events, concerts, exhibitions and educational workshops will focus on the regional Jewish legacy. Mark Podwal was commissioned to design all of the synagogue’s new textiles.

          Rhinebeck Jewish Center was constructed with recycled wood salvaged from an existing barn. Coupled with green technology, such as rainwater collection and passive heating and cooling, the new building, designed by Yeshaya Shor, is a green place of prayer. Mark Podwal’s <em>parochet</em> design features a menorah surrounded by the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Generally, the menorah’s branches are depicted as semi-circular. Nevertheless, <em>Rashi</em> in his commentary to the Torah, explicitly writes that the branches “extended upward in a diagonal.” The very Hebrew word, which the <em>Torah</em> uses to describe the branches, <em>ohbe</em>, implies a straight line.

          <h4 class="media-heading"><em>Torah</em> Ark Exterior Door Decoration</h4>
          Mark Podwal's Hebrew Zodiac is etched in copper on the exterior of the ark doors. The art is based on the following Talmudic verse: "He who sees the sun in its seasons, the moon in its fullness, the stars in their orbit, the planets in their fixed order, will say 'Blessed be the Creator of the Universe.'" Zodiac signs appeared frequently in early Jewish art particularly in synagogue floor mosaics. The balancing scale of Libra coincides with the month of Tishrei, the time of divine judgment. Taurus was linked to the calf slaughtered by Abraham for his three angelic guests while Gemini is said to represent Jacob and Esau. The twelve Zodiac signs were also said to correspond to the twelve tribes of Israel.

          "All that which I created, I created in pairs: Heaven and Earth a pair, the sun and moon a pair, Adam and Eve a pair" (<em>Song of Songs Rabbah</em>). Inspired by this verse, depicted are the sun and moon, a pair of <em>rimmonim</em>, a pair of <em>tefillin,</em> a pair of hands configuring the priestly blessing, a pair of <em>challot,</em> and the two tablets of the Ten Commandments protected by a pair of lions.

          The Echo Foundation commissioned Mark Podwal to design the “Sandra and Leon Levine Medal for Life.” Inspiration for the medal’s design came from the Levines’ philanthropic activities and their Jewish heritage. The front of the medal evokes an ancient Israeli coin, featuring a lyre and the biblical verse Psalm 89:3 in Paleo-Hebrew. The name of the medal, “Sandra and Leon Levine Medal for Life,” arcs halfway around the coin. The reverse side is inscribed with the same verse, which reads, “The world is built upon loving kindness,” in both Paleo-Hebrew and English.
